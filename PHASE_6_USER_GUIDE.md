## 🎓 Understanding the Scores

### Compliance Score (Suppliers)
```
100 = All certifications have > 30 days until expiry
80-99 = Most certifications are valid
60-79 = Some certifications need attention
40-59 = Many certifications expiring soon
< 40 = Urgent action needed
```

### Network Score (Brands)
```
Calculated from:
- 50% Supplier verification rate
- 50% Active certifications rate

90-100 = Excellent network compliance
70-89 = Good, some improvements possible
50-69 = Moderate, needs attention
< 50 = Poor, immediate action required
